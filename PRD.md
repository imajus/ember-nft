# AI-Powered NFT Launchpad: Project Concept Documentation

## Executive Summary

### Project Vision

A decentralized platform that democratizes NFT creation through AI-powered generation, enabling anyone to launch dynamic NFT collections with text prompts while introducing gamification elements through uncertainty in the minting process.

### Core Innovation

Unlike traditional NFT platforms where artwork is pre-generated, our system generates unique AI artwork at the moment of minting, creating a "mystery box" experience where collectors don't know exactly what they'll receive until after purchase.

### Value Propositions

- **For Creators**: Zero upfront costs, no technical barriers, AI-assisted creativity
- **For Collectors**: Gamified minting experience, guaranteed uniqueness, dynamic pricing discovery
- **For Derivative Creators**: Access to proven concepts, ability to remix and earn without audience
- **For the Ecosystem**: Sustainable economics, reduced speculation, increased utility focus, collaborative creation

## Economic Model

### Fee Structure

The platform implements a transparent fee structure where all costs are added on top of the creator's base price. For forked collections, revenue is shared across the lineage chain.

```mermaid
pie title "Total Minter Cost Breakdown (Example)"
    "Creator Price" : 70
    "Platform Fee (15%)" : 10.5
    "AI Generation" : 1
    "Storage" : 0.5
```

**Standard Collection Fee Calculation:**

```
Total Minter Cost = Creator Price + (Creator Price Ã— Platform Fee %) + AI Fee + Storage Fee
Creator Receives = Creator Price (100%)
Platform Receives = Platform Fee + AI Fee + Storage Fee
```

**Fork Collection Revenue Distribution:**

For forked collections, a portion of the creator's revenue is shared with the original creator and fork lineage:

- Original Creator: 10% of mint price (constant across all fork levels)
- Fork creators receive diminishing shares based on their position in the lineage
- Current fork creator receives the remainder after lineage distributions

**Example (Standard Collection):**

- Creator sets price: 10 USDC
- Platform fee (15%): 1.5 USDC
- AI generation fee: 1 USDC
- Storage fee: 0.5 USDC
- **Total minter pays: 13 USDC**
- **Creator receives: 10 USDC**
- **Platform receives: 3 USDC**

### Revenue Streams

1. **Transaction Fees**

   - Fixed percentage of creator price (e.g., 15%)
   - Applied uniformly to all collections

2. **Service Fees**
   - AI generation fee per mint
   - Storage fee per mint
   - Set in smart contract constructor

3. **Fork Lineage Fees**
   - Revenue sharing from derivative collections
   - Diminishing returns model for sustainable growth
   - Encourages original creation while enabling remixing
